## Journal

### 2025-05-18
Lookead at different `librosa.feature.melspectrogram` params:
* Changed `N_FFT` to `2048` from `1024`
* Changed `HOP_LENGTH` to `512` from `256`
* Changed `FMIN` from `20` to `50`
* `FMAX` seems to be better at `15000`, not `14000`
These changes were made due to the seemingly clearer and full image. However, we have to investigate it with training and validation. 

### 2025-05-19
* Tested mel spectrograms precomputation â€” indeed, it increased the training speed.  

## Hypotheses

[] Remove human voice https://www.kaggle.com/code/kdmitrie/bc25-separation-voice-from-data https://www.kaggle.com/code/timothylovett/human-voice-removal-caution-around-ruther1  
[] Do we need `mel_spec_norm`?  
[] Shall we pad audio if it is less than 5s instead of copying it?
